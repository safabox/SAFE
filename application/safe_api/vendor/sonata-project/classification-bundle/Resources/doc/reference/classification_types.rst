Classification Types
====================

You can use 3 kind of Classification types:

Tag
---

A `tag` is a label attached to someone or something for identification or other information.

`Usage`: A blog post can have many tags.

Collection
----------

A `collection` is a group of objects or works to be seen, studied, or kept together.

`Usage`: A blog post belongs to one collection.

Category
--------

A `category` is a class or division of things regarded as having particular shared characteristics.

`Usage`: A product available through a shop belongs to one or many categories.

For more practical examples, don't hesitate to test the public demo of `Sonata <http://demo.sonata-project.org>`_.
If you want to know more, you can fork the `Sonata sandbox <https://github.com/sonata-project/sandbox>`_ from Github.com and analyse how it's built.


Context
=======

A Context is a way to group `Tag`, `Collection` and `Category` into one set. So you can have duplicate tag accross contexts.
